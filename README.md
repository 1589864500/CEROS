# CEROS: Cost-Efficient Fraud Risk Optimization with Submodularity in Insurance Claim

## Introduction

CEROS (Cost-Efficient Fraud Risk Optimization with Submodularity) is a novel framework designed to optimize the fraud risk verification process in the insurance industry. By efficiently allocating investigation resources across multiple information sources, CEROS aims to balance the trade-off between accuracy and cost effectively. The framework comprises two main components: a submodular set-wise classification model (SSCM) for estimating the submodular objective function, and a primal-dual algorithm with segmentation point (PDA-SP) for solving the objective function. This approach not only accelerates the convergence speed by 66.9% but also reduces the verification cost by 18.8% compared to traditional methods. CEROS has been successfully deployed in Alipay, showcasing its effectiveness in healthcare insurance recommendation and claim verification.
